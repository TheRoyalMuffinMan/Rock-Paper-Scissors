# Rock Paper Scissors
- Live Demo: https://theroyalmuffinman.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/
This is an exercise to create a sign-up form similar to a provided [design]("https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png"). I decided to change up the design a bit and give it a stand-up paddling theme, including changing the main color to blue.
This project is a implementation of the friendly game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The languages used for this project consist of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
